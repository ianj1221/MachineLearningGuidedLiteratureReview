CONSTITUTION:A cationic electrodeposition coating A is applied to form a coating film, the surface of the unhardened film is coated with an org.-solvent coating, and both coating films are simultaneously hardened to form a double- layer coating film. The coating A with the coating film loss X controlled to 10wt.% when the dehydrated electrodeposition coating film is heated and hardened is used in this method. The electrodeposited film is not bled and the film is smoothly hardened by this method, and the desired coating film is obtained. The loss X is obtained by performing cationic electrodeposition under ordinary conditions, pulling up the obtained film from an electrodeposition bath, washing the coated surface with water, heating the film at 105 deg.C for 3hr to remove all or almost all the moisture in the film and then measuring the weight of the film. The coating film is then heated at 170 deg.C for 20min and then three-dimensionally cross-linked and hardened, and the weight of the coating film is measured to calculate the loss.",1,1

The two resins included in the coating are a reaction product of an epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A plus a polyurethane elastomer which is a reaction product of an aromatic isocyanate and a polyether glycol. The curing agent is a blocked diamine, i.e., a ketimine. The ketimine can be prepared by reacting a carbonyl compound and an aromatic diamine. Water is produced in this reaction. The reaction is reversible, so that as the ketimine absorbs atmospheric moisture, the aromatic diamine is released and in turn cures or cross-links the resins. The mixture of pigmentation, resins, ketimine, and solvent blend is a sprayable material that can be readily applied to surfaces using conventional spray equipment. After application, as the diamine is released, the coating is cured to a tough weather-resistant film. When utilized to protect exterior surfaces, a durable exterior coating can then be applied over the flexible sealant-primer to obtain a two-coat, all weather protective paint system.",3,

Environmental icing due to weather is a related problem, but is not the direct problem concerning the present invention. Ice will not form on the surface of certain polymer coatings with low surface energy such as TeflonTM. This is a consequence of the high contact angle between the water droplet and the surface that establishes a non-wetting surface. The objective of the present invention is to implement such coatings and a deposition process. Effective implementation will also result in a coating formulation and deposition process.

A vehicle that can prevent the reversal between layers and the phenomenon of mixed layers, prevent the top coat from being absorbed into the middle coating, and prevent the popping phenomenon during final curing by promoting the middle drying speed. It relates to a method for forming a multilayer coating film. The coating film forming method according to the present invention can make a great contribution to not only energy saving but also productivity improvement and environmental pollutant reduction by shortening the coating process. __Ê_ÅÊ, __ê_è¶_≠™, _è∆__Ô, _è∆_œÑ, __ê__êê≠ÍêÊê_¶‡, _›∆_É≠_æµDuplex, Automobile, Painting, Coating, Particle Crosslinking, Dispersion",,

SOLUTION: A hard coat layer showing outstanding hard coat properties is applied on the surface of each of various kinds of an object. The ratio of a silicon atom and a carbon atom in the hard coat layer (Si/C) is set to be 0.1-10.0. The ratio of Si and C in the hard coat layer can be set by an X-ray electrospectrometry. When the ratio of Si/C is less than 0.1, this means that the Si content of the hard coat layer is at a low level. Thus the dense polysiloxane part of a polymer forming the hard coat layer is reduced so that the hard coat properties are not developed. In addition, the performance such as wear resistance, impact resistance or durability of the hard coat layer is not enhanced.

In other words, the individual components are not mixed with each other. In the second option of the coating material system according to the invention, conversely, the components may be mixed together in whole or at least partly. If the components are at least partly mixed with one another, this is, for example, mixing component (C) with component (A), while components (B) and (D) are the components (A) and (C). It means that it exists separately from the mixture. Optionally, however, component (B) or (D) may be mixed with a portion of component (C). Furthermore, the mixture of (A) and (C), and the mixture of (B) or (D) and (C) may further contain at least one optional component such as a solvent.  Component (A) contains at least one polyhydroxy group-containing compound having an acid value not exceeding 9 mg KOH / g (corresponding polyhydroxy group-containing compound), and component (B) Contains at least one polyisocyanate-containing compound. Component (C), in contrast, is a catalyst containing bismuth as a metal component, the catalyst being present as a salt of at least one organic acid and component (D) being an aromatic carboxylic acid. The aromatic carboxylic acid of component (D) and the organic acid of component (C) are different from each other. Additional components that may be present in the coating material system of the present invention include, for example, coating additives (F), hydroxyl-containing compounds (G), pigments (H) and / or solvents (J).",,

The compositions may further include an organometallic catalyst. It is believed that the volatile organic acid temporarily drives the formation of amine salts in the composition, thereby inhibiting amine/isocyanate crosslinking, and, where an organometallic catalyst is present, inhibits catalysis. Both of these inhibitory effects are reversed upon acid evaporation, which may substantially occur after the composition has been applied to a substrate. The delay in crosslinking achieved by use of the acid, however, may facilitate more complete evaporation of solvents from the coating, resulting in improved coating properties.",,

The method of coating allows substrates coated with weldable primer to be assembled into assemblies or finished parts by welding, and then to be coated with the powder basecoat and clear coat. The parts prepared have striking visual effects and performance comparable to conventional automotive parts but are prepared more efficiently and economically. ",,

The water-based acrylic coating shows good water-resistance in the early stage, which passes the water-sealing test. In addition, secure and convenient in application, the water-based acrylic coating has no pollution to the environment and is harmless to the workers. Suitable for high-pressure airless spraying, the water-based acrylic coating has high operation efficiency. The thickness of a single coating layer is thirty to one hundred micron and no more coating layer is needed as no sagging or cracking can be found in a single coating layer. The water-based acrylic coating can not only be used for the decoration and protection of the outer surface of a container, but also can be widely used as antirust for the iron and steel parts of transportation means like automobiles, trains and ships; of structures like bridges, towers, doors and windows; and of facilities like tanks and pipes.",,

The primer serves as a barrier to block ultraviolet light penetration to the underlying substrate and to prevent migration of substrate degradation and by-products up into the topcoat finishes. The primer is a solvent blend of a film-forming crosslinkable polymer resin, a crosslinker for the resin, a catalyst, carbon black pigments surface modified with a polymer dispersant and an organic pigment derivative co-dispersant, crosslinked polymer microgel particles, and U.V. absorbers and optional antioxidants. The surface modification on the carbon black pigments results in higher pigment loadings, which, in turn, imparts U.V. light protection at exceptionally low dry film builds. Furthermore, the microgel particles cause the primer to build in viscosity and set up a gel structure in its uncured state, which allows the primer to be overcoated wet-on-wet with automotive topcoat finishes and cured simultaneously in a single bake without diminishing the topcoat appearance and physical properties. The need for a separate primer bake prior to topcoat application is, therefore, eliminated.",,
